Did you ever want for Minecraft chat to be more like Discord? Or Steam Chat?

## Download

The mod is WIP so there are no releases yet.
If you want to try it out, you can build it yourself.

In the future, the mod will be available for download on Modrinth.

## Can I use this mod in my modpack?

Yes, of course! No need to ask. Just make sure to credit me.
